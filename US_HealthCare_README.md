## 🚀 Key Insights

### Health Condition Analysis – Gender Based
- **Hypertension:** Most prevalent (22% of total cases), with **61% in males**  
- **Cancer:** Nearly equal between genders (836 females vs. 811 males)  
- **Obesity:** Higher in females (**62%**), indicating lifestyle/metabolic factors  
- **Diabetes:** More common in females (57%)  
- **Arthritis & Asthma:** Nearly balanced; arthritis slightly higher in females, asthma slightly higher in males  

**Strategic Implications:**  
- Targeted health initiatives: hypertension awareness for men, obesity management for women  
- Gender-specific preventive programs for metabolic conditions  
- Resource allocation focused on high-risk conditions  
- Further research into lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors

### Health Condition Analysis – Blood Group
- **Hypertension:** Highest in B+ (282 cases out of 2155)  
- **Obesity:** Highest in AB- (239 cases), lowest in B+ (182)  
- **Diabetes:** Highest in B- (197 cases), lowest in O+ (155)  
- **Other conditions:** Cancer, arthritis, asthma evenly distributed  
- **Overall:** All blood groups have ~12.5% share

### Admission Type Analysis
- **Emergency:** Highest revenue ($87M) and average billing ($24,279), 3.8% above average  
- **Elective:** $70.9M revenue, average billing $23,039 (-1.5%)
